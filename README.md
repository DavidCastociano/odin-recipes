In this HTML project I will be demonstrating a basic understanding of the fundamentals of HTML. This will include:
-setting up a rudimentary HTML boilerplate,
-developing a code structure with hopefully, proper indentation
-display an adequate competency in using anchor tags, links(understanding absolute and relative)
-understand how elements work and MAKE SURE THEY ARE PROPERLY BRACKETED.
-body structure with proper paragraph usage.
-an understanding in how ordered lists and unordererd lists work.
-a better understanding of git basics in order internalize normal workflow.
