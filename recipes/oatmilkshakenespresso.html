        <p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></p>
        <p>Brown Sugar Syrup</p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 tbsp lightly packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>6 tbsp water</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Lattes</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 double shots of espresso</li>
                <li>A mason jar or cocktail shaker with a few icecubes</li>
                <li>2 glasses filled halfway with ice</li>
                <li>Oatmilk (as much as you need to top up the cup)</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>STEPS</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small frying pan or pot on the stove, add the syrup ingredients and heat on medium-high, whisking to combine. Once it starts simmering, lower the heat to medium-low and simmer about 3-5 minutes, stirring frequently, until sugar has completely dissolved and syrup has thickened just slightly. Remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
                <li>Brew two shots of espresso or about 1/2 cup of very strong coffee. Add to the mason jar with 3 tbsp of syrup and a few ice cubes and shake vigorously for about 1-2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Add some more ice to each glass. Divide the espresso mixture between the glasses. Add oat milk to top it up. Stir and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
